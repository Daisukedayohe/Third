The Pagani Huayra is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian 
sports car manufacturer Pagani, succeeding the company's previous 
offering, the Zonda. It is named after Wind, like the previous model 
(Zonda), the word Huayra came from a Quechua which translates to the 
word for wind.[4] And not related to Huayra Tata. The Huayra was 
named "The Hypercar of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine. On 11 February 
2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra
 was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine 
 supplier Mercedes-AMG. The Pagani Huayra was officially debuted online with
  several pictures in a press release on 25 January 2011. The official world 
  debut was at the headquarters of Pirelli in Milan in February 2011.
