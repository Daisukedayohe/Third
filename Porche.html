    First launched in 2005 for the 2006 model year, 
    the Cayman is a coupé derived from Porsche's second 
    and third generation Boxster roadster, styled in its 
    first iteration by Pinky Lai. All Caymans were manufactured 
    in Finland by Valmet Automotive. As Volkswagen assumed 
    control of Porsche AG, production of Caymans and Boxsters 
    after 2012 began in the former Karmann plant in Osnabrück, 
    Germany, at the time owned by Volkswagen and also used for 
    production of the 2012 Golf (Mk6) convertible. The 
    car is not named after the Cayman Islands. Both the car 
    and the islands are named after the caiman, a member of 
    the alligator family. When the Cayman arrived at dealerships 
    for sale, the automaker adopted four caimans at Stuttgart's 
    Wilhelma Zoo. Porsche brought an infringement lawsuit in 2009 
    against Crocs, the maker of the popular rubber shoes. At issue was 
    the footwear company's clog name also called Cayman. An injunction 
    was granted against Crocs Europe, a division of the Longmont, 
    Colorado-based shoe company preventing their use in Germany of the 
    Cayman name.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Boxster/Cayman">more</a></font></h2>
