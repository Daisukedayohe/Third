    Aspirations are for those who hope to make it big; 
    the 2020 McLaren 570S is for those who actually do. 
    Make no mistake, this mid-engine sports car isn't just 
    meant to cruise the boulevard or attract gawkers everywhere 
    it goes. No. Both models the sporty 570S and the topless 570S 
    Spider—have driver engagement engrained into their DNA. Each 
    feature a soulful 562-hp twin-turbo V-8 that provides amazing 
    acceleration and wails like a heavy-metal band. Combine that 
    with the sharp-edged cornering of an Olympic figure skater and 
    the grip of a vise and you essentially have the highlights of 
    driving any of these magnificent McLarens. There's a big difference 
    between a supercar pretender and a supercar contender—the 2020 
    570 clan is the latter.<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/mclaren/570s-570gt">more</a></font></h2>
